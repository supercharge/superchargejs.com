title: Supercharge 3.0 Released

This week we shipped Supercharge 3.0 ðŸ¥³ itâ€™s an exciting chapter bringing you the newest framework additions and a completely new session package.

Supercharge 3 new ships a new [session package](/docs/session). HTTP sessions allow you to keep a state across requests and remember information for users.


### Sessions
The Supercharge 3.x release line ships with a new `@supercharge/session` package. You may check out the [session docs](/docs/session) for more details.

#### All New Supercharge Projects Ship With Session Support
We added sessions to the application boilerplate. Youâ€™ll have sessions configured when creating a new Supercharge application.


#### Adding Sessions to your Existing Supercharge Project
You can add HTTP sessions to your existing application. First, install the package as a project dependency:

```bash
npm i @supercharge/session
```

Then change the following files and add the given content:

`app/http/kernel.ts`

```ts
import { StartSessionMiddleware as StartSession } from '@supercharge/session'

export class HttpKernel extends Kernel {
  override middleware (): Array<MiddlewareCtor | Class> {
    return [
      StartSession,
    ]
  }
}
```

`bootstrap/providers.ts`

```ts
import { SessionServiceProvider } from '@supercharge/session'

export const providers: ServiceProviderCtor[] = [
  â€¦
  SessionServiceProvider,
]
```

The last step is to add the `config/session.ts` file. Please create that file in your project and copy and paste [the content from the config file on GitHub](https://github.com/supercharge/supercharge/blob/develop/config/session.ts).


### HTTP State Bag
Supercharge v3 changed the way youâ€™re sharing state across controller and middleware along the request lifecycle. The shared state in v2 could be anything, like an object, or a string, or an array.

This changed in v3 where the state is always an object. We also introduced a state bag to interact with the shared state. The state bag provides methods like `get`, `set`, `has`, `remove`, `all`, `clear`.

**Supercharge v2**

```ts
// setting values
request.state().userId = 'user-identifier'

// getting values
request.state().userId
// 'user-identifier'
```

**Supercharge v3**

```ts
// setting values
request.state().set('userId', 'user-identifier')

// getting values
request.state().get('userId')
// 'user-identifier'
```

Please find more details in the [HTTP docs on sharing state](/docs/requests).


### Extended HTTP Request and Response
We extended the `Request` and `Response` classes within the `@supercharge/http` package.


#### Sharing State
Both classes now extend the `InteractsWithState` mixin. Interacting with the state from requests and responses allows you to share information to a central store from both instances:

```ts
import { HttpContext } from '@supercharge/contracts'

class SignupController {
  /**
   * Handle the given request.
   */
  async handle({ request, response }: HttpContext): Promise<void> {
    // share information along the request lifecycle
    request.state().set('userId', 'user-identifier')

    // works as well and youâ€˜re writing to the same session store as the request
    response.state().set('name', 'Supercharge')
  }
}
```


#### Macroable Requests
We also made the HTTP `Request` class macroable. This letâ€™s you extend a `request` instance with your custom method. Hereâ€™s an example how the `@supercharge/session` package decorates the `request.session()` method:

```ts
import { ServiceProvider } from '@supercharge/support'
import { HttpRequest, Session } from '@supercharge/contracts'
import { StartSessionMiddleware } from './middleware/start-session'

export class SessionServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
  /**
   * Register the `request.session()` macro function to the request constructor.
   */
  override async boot (): Promise<void> {
    const Request = this.app().make<HttpRequest>('request')
    const session = this.app().make<SessionManager>('session')

    Request.macro('session', function (this: HttpRequest) {
      return session.createFrom(this.ctx())
    })
  }
}
```


### New Config Methods
We extended the `@supercharge/config` package and added the following methods:

- `isEmpty(key)`: determine whether the config store contains an item for the given `key` with is empty
- `isNotEmpty(key)`: determine whether the config store contains an item for the given `key` with is not empty
- `ensureNotEmpty(key)`: throws an error if the config store contains an item for the given key which has an empty value

Find more details in the [config docs](/docs/configuration).


### Visibility Changes in the Manager
The `Manager` class from the `@supercharge/manager` package now uses `protected` method visibilities to allow access from parent classes. Previously, we used the `private` visibility but that constraint isnâ€™t flexible when extending the `Manager` base class.


### Breaking Changes and Upgrade Guide v2 to v3
We needed to introduce some breaking changes for the v3 release. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of breaking changes.


#### Node.js v16 Required
Supercharge v3 requires Node.js 16. You may check out the [docs on system requirements](https://superchargejs.com/docs/3.x/installation#system-requirements) to find more information on how to upgrade the installed Node.js version.


#### Shutdown Method in Service Providers
Starting with the v3 release you can implement an `async shutdown()` method in your `ServiceProvider` instances. The `shutdown` method will be called by the application instance when receiving a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signal. Both signals are usually emitted when using CTRL+C in your terminal to stop a process.

Hereâ€™s a sample service provider using the `shutdown` method to stop a database connection:

```ts
import { ServiceProvider } from '@supercharge/support'

export class MongodbServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider implements ServiceProviderContract {
  /**
   * Register MongoDB services into the container.
   */
  override register (): void {
    this.app().singleton('mongodb', () => {
      // â€¦
    })
  }

  /**
   * Stop MongoDB connections.
   */
  override async shutdown (): Promise<void> {
    await this.app().make('mongodb').disconnect()
  }
}
```

Find more details in the [service provider docs](/docs/service-providers#the-shutdown-method).


#### Container Aliases
The Supercharge service container supports binding aliases starting in v3. Binding aliases describe alternative keys pointing to a binding.

Hereâ€™s an example used in the framework. The Supercharge HTTP server uses the `server` binding. To be more specific what server instance will be resolved, we added the `http.server` alias for the `server` binding. Hereâ€™s the code used in the HTTP service provider:

```ts
this.app()
  .singleton('server', () => new Server(this.app()))
  .alias('server', 'http.server')

const server = app.make('http.server')
// resolves the HTTP server instance
```

Find more details in the [service container docs](/docs/service-container).
